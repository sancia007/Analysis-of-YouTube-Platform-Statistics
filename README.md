# Analysis-of-YouTube-Platform-Statistics

---


Welcome to our comprehensive analysis of YouTube platform statistics, where we dive into the vast world of YouTube data to uncover insights about content trends, channel growth, and much more. This project is brought to you by a dedicated team consisting of Harsh Khot, Shubhi Sinha, Sancia Saldhana, and Charan Kumar Dolampatti, who have meticulously worked on collecting, preprocessing, analyzing, and visualizing YouTube data.

## Project Overview

Our project aims to provide an in-depth analysis of YouTube's platform statistics, focusing on categories like entertainment, music, channel growth, and the impact of YouTube's monetization policy. We explore which content categories lead across various metrics and how channel growth has evolved over the years.

## Key Insights

- **Entertainment and Music Dominate**: These categories lead across all metrics, highlighting their popularity and engagement on the platform.
- **Monetization Policy Impact**: A significant spike in channel growth was observed from 2000 to 2010, likely influenced by YouTube's monetization policy introduced in 2007.
- **Leading Channels**: T-Series and Set India are among the top channels across all metrics.
- **Correlation Between Uploads and Subscribers**: There's a high correlation, suggesting that frequent uploads can be key to growing a subscriber base.
- **Geographical Presence**: The United States and India are leading in YouTube presence, showcasing the global appeal of the platform.
- **Non-Profits and Their Unique Position**: Non-profits have a high median number of subscribers but fewer outliers compared to entertainment and music channels.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from the National Archives' collection of social media channels and statistics, which includes extensive data on YouTube channels, their categories, subscriber counts, video uploads, and other relevant metrics.

## Data Pre-processing and Visualization

We've taken several steps to clean and preprocess the data, ensuring accuracy and reliability in our findings. The analysis involves a range of data visualization techniques to present our insights effectively. Graphs and charts have been used extensively to depict trends, distributions, and correlations within the YouTube data.

## Repository Contents
